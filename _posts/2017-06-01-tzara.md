This series of posts will document my exploration of algorithmically generated
poetry.

For this post, I start with a very simple model of generative poetry. I call
this the *naive Tzarian* model after Tristan Tzara's *How to Make a Dadaist
Poem* (1920).

> Take a newspaper.
> Take a pair of scissors.  
> Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.  
> Cut out the article.  
> Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.  
> Shake it gently.  
> Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.  
> Copy conscientiously.  
> The poem will be like you.  
> And here you areâ€”an infinitely original author of charming sensibility,  
  &nbsp; &nbsp; even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.  

I call this model *naive* because you will have little success in creating
viable poetry if you follow Tzara's method as written. This model's
incompleteness is what makes makes it useful, and, I suspect, an important
part of Tzara's own intent in writing it. It gives us a baseline against
which we can begin to formailze the requirements for more complex models of
generative poetics.

I tried it out with the first paragraph of an article about a spelling bee.
Here's how it looked:

Unfortunately this fails as language before it has a chance to fail at being
a poem. (It does, however, have a certain appeal as a sort of textual mosiac.)

By way of comparison, let's look at an excerpt from another of Tzara's poems,
*Vegetable Swallow.*

>*Vegetable Swallow*
>
> two smiles meet towards  
> the child-wheel of my zeal  
> the bloody baggage of creatures  
> made flesh in physical legends-lives  
>  
> the nimble stags storms cloud over  
> rain falls under the scissors of  
> the dark hairdresser-furiously  
> swimming under the clashing arpeggios  

While I expect readers will have a range of reactions to *Vegetable Swallow*,
it's clear that Tzara's work compares very favorably to the output of my naive
Tzarian model. The wording is unusual, yes, and the syntax, especially without
puncutation, is slippery, but Tzara's actual poetry is clearly a production
of natural language in ways that scissors and a newspaper cannot simulate.

To bring the contrast into sharper focus, I've re-randomized *Vegetable
Swallow*

> strikes arpeggios with of hairdresser  
> stags the under over scissors with  
> share swimming made and dead flesh  
> of sharp the creatures of itself grows   
>   
> storms the to the non baggage hairs  
> human gives meet bloody grass sap  
> by the the hands physical our clashing  
> departed waves spices of two the  
    
I admire phrases like "dead flesh of sharp creatures", but these gems are
interspersed jarring syntactical non-starters. "With of" and "the to the" are
not interesting violations of our poetic expectations, they're just boring
nonsense. Tzara's original has a patch or two of tortured syntax, but shows a
degree of syntactical coherence we would be very unlikely to see in a random
arrangement. We also see complex tense and number agreements in phrases like
"two smiles meet," and even a few instances of clear semantic coherence, like
the match of a tool to its handler in "the scissors of the dark hairdresser."

To make a good poem, I'll need to address some of these fundamental linguistic
challenges before I begin to work on poetic features like rhyme and meter. In
the episodes to follow, I'll discuss some models that should do better than the
naive Tzarian.
