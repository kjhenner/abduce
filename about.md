This is a place for me to share my exploration of language (words) and ontology
(things). I'm interested in how statistical and computational methods can help
understand the arts and human sciences.

I work as Training Solutions Engineer at a place called
[Puppet](www.puppet.com) in Portland, Oregon. I think I have a masters degree
in cultural anthropology, but I never got it in the mail.
