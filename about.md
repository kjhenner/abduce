This is a place for me to share my exploration of language (words) and ontology
(things). I'm interested in how statistical and computational methods can help
us understand the arts and human sciences.

The blog's title is the imperative form of
[abduction](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/), the lesser-known and
understood third sibling to the more familiar *inductive* and *deductive* forms
of inference. To abduce is to guess that something is true because it's a good
explanation for an otherwise-surprising observation.

I work as Training Solutions Engineer at a place called
[Puppet](www.puppet.com) in Portland, Oregon. I think I have a masters degree
in cultural anthropology, but I never got it in the mail.
