Can a computer tell me what I want to cite?

My encounters with academic research always leave me dragging tangles of
unpursued citations like a sea monster drags fish nets and strands of
kelp. And as the deadline approaches, the network grows without bound.

Yes, perhaps a better researcher rigorously defines a project's scope then
diligently consumes the topic's key, then minor, works. Icy-hearted, she spurns
tangents without a second glance. I imagine her stack of papers marked
"to-read" rises for a while, reaches an apogee, floats, for a moment, in
parabolic zero-gravity, then turns and plummets down to nothing. Picture her
smugness on turning to the final bibliography and seeing that the listed names
have all the empty familiarity of a Facebook feed.

I am not that better researcher, and whether by real preference or necessity,
I've come to
