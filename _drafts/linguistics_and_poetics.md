Neo-pragmatism

What causes poetry, what effects does poetry have?

The breakdown of distinctions among forms of language.

Origin of author with its grounds in Cartesian thought. Distinction between the
subject and object. This is elided by generative poetry.

Death of the author, Barthes. Author function, Foucault.

Before moving on in explorations of algorithms, I will address three important
questions:

  1. How will I know if I've generated a poem?
  2. What is a poem anyway?
  3. What is a "what is..." question and what form does a useful answer take?

These questions must be answered in descending order of pedantry, that is,
three, two, one.

I start with question three because there's a potential category mistake
lurking in any "what is..." question. Linguistically speaking, a word can have
a few different kinds of meaning. In general usage, these different kinds of
meaning mostly overlap, so nobody needs worry much about them. When people
start asking "what is..." questions ("what is pornography?" "what is a
sandwich?", "what is love?"), we start seeing the messiness around the edges of
categories.

Linguistic philospohers talk about two different kinds of meaning: *intension*
and *extension*. Intension is a word's intrinsic meaning: the poem-ness of a
poem that justifies use of the word to name it. Extension is the set of of
things in the world to which the word corresponds: all the actual poems
floating around out there in space.

If a poem were a precisely defined logical or mathematical concept, its
intension and extension would correspond exactly. Anything with the quality of
poem-ness would fall into the set of poems and anything in the set of poems
would be sure to have the essential quality of poem-ness.

In reality, however, this correspondence is messier. Unlike numbers or logical
concepts, the set of poems is made up of individual specimens realized only
through historical contingency and the caprice of poets. We can't reason from
any first principles that Shakespeare should write his 154 sonnets just so,
that Milton's Satan should be "hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky,"
or that William Carlos Williams should open the icebox and come upon those
cold, delicious plums.

Does the extension of the word "poem" cover only the poems actually composed,
or does it include all possible poems

In such cases, a "what is..." is the echo between the shifting surfaces of
intension and extension that may find resonances, patches of stability, but is
fundamentally open 





Intensive
Extensive
Ostensive

Ostensive subset
Generalized ostensive subset

To answer that, in turn, I have to take a run at the whole class of
"what is a..." questions.

Jakobson 1960

For Jakobson, this question comes down to that of "what makes a verbal message
a work of art?"

"...many devices studied by poetics are not confined to verbal art."

Once can illustrate a poem, or translate prose to film. The result is
transformed, certainly, but artistic elements persist.

"..many poetic features belong not only to the science of language, but to the
whole theory of signs, that is, to general semiotics"

"...language shares many properties with certain other systems of signs or even
with all of them (pansemiotic features)."

"Insistence on keeping poetics apart from linguistics is warranted only when the field of
linguistics appears to be illicitly restricted, for example, when the sentence
is viewed by some linguists as the highest analyzable construction, or when the scope of linguistics is
confined to grammar alone or uniquely to nonsemantic questions of external form 
or to the inventory of denotative devices with no reference to free variations."

For Jakobson, the expulsion of emotive elements from linguistic science is
a *reductio ad absurdum*. "Language," he writes, "must be investigated in all the
variety of its functions," the "poetic function" among them. Jacobson
